Have you ever been in a rush to create a webpage with Bootstrap and add colorful social buttons?
Well, I have, and it was a pain to customize each and every color on each and every css.

**Introducing Social Buttons for Bootstrap.**

_So is this a hack?_  
No, it's just css and Font Awesome.

_Why would I use it?_  
I don't know, it's just copy paste, which is remarkably faster than doing it yourself.

_Is it free?_  
Of course it is! It's based off Bootstrap (Free) and Font Awesome's Free tier (whoa, also free), so I find 0 enjoyment on taking your money.

_Hey, I can do that too, why would I download your project?_  
That's the fun thing, you don't have to (:

# Installation
Just downlaod the ``.css`` and ``.html`` to copy the buttons you want to use and that's it. Don't forget to link the css though!

# Requirements
Just Font Awesome's free tier. You can use the included link or get yours at [Font Awesome's webpage.](https://fontawesome.com)
